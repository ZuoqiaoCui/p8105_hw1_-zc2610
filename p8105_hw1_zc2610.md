# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Description:

1.  This dataset contains 8 variables in total:
    species,island,bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm,
    body_mass_g,sex,year.
2.  This dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns of data

# Problem 2

``` r
  problem2_df = 
  tibble(
  norm = rnorm(n = 10),
  logical_vector = norm > 0,
  character_vector = c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10"),
  factor_vector = factor(c("first","first","first","second","second","second","second","second","third","third"))
  )
```

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, norm))
```

    ## [1] -0.03798097

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, logical_vector))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, character_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, character_vector)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, factor_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, factor_vector)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

According to the output of code above, we can learn that “norm” and
“logical” variable can output the mean because their arguments are
numeric or logical. “character_vector” and “factor_vector” doesn’t work
with the mean and return NA since arguments are not numeric or logical

``` r
logical_vector2 = as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, logical_vector))
character_vector2 = as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, character_vector))
factor_vector2 = as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, factor_vector))
```

``` r
mean(logical_vector2)
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(character_vector2)
```

    ## [1] 5.5

``` r
mean(factor_vector2)
```

    ## [1] 1.9

According to the code above, we can learn that after converting logical,
character and factor vectors into numeric type using as.numeric, the
mean of character and factor variables can be worked out. Thus, the
reason is that mean function can only work with numeric and logical data
type. Character and factor type of data should be converted into numeric
in order to get the mean output.
